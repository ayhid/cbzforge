## Performance Tips

### Download Speed
1. **Internet Connection**: Faster connection = faster downloads
2. **Site Load**: Popular sites may be slower during peak hours
3. **Chapter Range**: Download smaller batches for better reliability
4. **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays prevent overwhelming servers

### System Resources
1. **Memory**: Each browser instance uses ~100MB RAM
2. **Storage**: Ensure enough disk space for downloads
3. **CPU**: Minimal CPU usage, mostly waiting for network

### Optimizing Downloads

**For Large Collections:**
```bash
# Instead of downloading 100 chapters at once:
node multi-site-downloader.js "Manga" "all" site

# Break into smaller chunks:
node multi-site-downloader.js "Manga" "1-25" site
node multi-site-downloader.js "Manga" "26-50" site
node multi-site-downloader.js "Manga" "51-75" site
node multi-site-downloader.js "Manga" "76-100" site
```

**For Reliability:**
- Download during off-peak hours
- Use stable internet connection
- Don't run multiple instances simultaneously
